# portalturret

This a small adaptation of the Portal turret from [Joran de Raaf](https://github.com/joranderaaff/portalturret).

All credit to him for the original design.

I used platformio to build the code and upload it to the ESP8266.

Next step is to add MQTT support to control and get status of the turret with Home-Assistant.
